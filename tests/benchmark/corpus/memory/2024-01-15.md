# 2024-01-15: Initial Architecture Decisions

## API Design

Decided to use REST over GraphQL for the public API. Reasoning:
- Simpler caching with HTTP semantics
- Better tooling support for OpenAPI spec generation
- Team familiarity with REST patterns

GraphQL will be considered for the internal dashboard API in the future.

## Database Choice

Chose PostgreSQL over MySQL for the following reasons:
- Better JSON support (jsonb type)
- Advanced indexing (GIN, GiST)
- Better concurrency with MVCC
- Extension ecosystem (PostGIS, pgvector)

## Original API Design Decision

The original API versioning strategy uses URL path versioning (/v1/, /v2/).
Header-based versioning was rejected because:
- Less discoverable for API consumers
- Harder to route at the load balancer level
- No clear cache key separation

We committed to maintaining backward compatibility within a major version
for at least 12 months after deprecation notice.
