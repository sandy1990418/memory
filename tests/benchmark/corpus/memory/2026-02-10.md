# 2026-02-10: Recent Deployment Updates

## Production Deployment Last Week

Deployed v3.2.1 to production on February 7th. Changes included:
- Fixed race condition in WebSocket connection handler
- Added request deduplication middleware
- Upgraded Redis client library to v5.0.1

Post-deployment metrics showed:
- 15% reduction in p99 latency
- WebSocket reconnection errors dropped from 2.3% to 0.1%
- Memory usage decreased by 8% due to connection pooling fix

## Staging Environment Changes

Staging now mirrors production configuration exactly. Previously staging
used a single Redis instance while production used a cluster. This caused
several bugs that only appeared in production.

## Upcoming Migration Plan

Planning to migrate from REST to gRPC for internal service communication.
Timeline: Q2 2026. REST will remain for the public API.

Benefits expected:
- Strict schema enforcement with protobuf
- Bidirectional streaming for real-time features
- ~40% reduction in inter-service latency
